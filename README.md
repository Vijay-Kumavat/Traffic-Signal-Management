# Traffic-Signal-Management
 The provided Blazor code implements a Traffic Signal Management system. It consists of two main sections: 

1. **Traffic Analyzer**: This section displays real-time traffic analysis information, including the current open direction, next open direction, remaining time, and selected direction. Additionally, it features buttons labeled A, B, C, and D, representing various traffic directions. These buttons dynamically change color based on the interval time.

2. **Global Configuration**: In this section, users can configure the traffic signal system by selecting the direction and setting the interval time for each signal change. Upon submission, the system updates the signal configuration accordingly.

The layout is designed with a clean and organized structure, utilizing Bootstrap classes for styling and responsiveness. The Traffic Signal Management system aims to provide users with a user-friendly interface for monitoring and configuring traffic signals efficiently.
